## Environment Variables
Place a `.env` file in the top level of the directory you've cloned. These variables will be automatically assigned to `process.env` when the application boots. It is gitignored by default as it's not good practice to store your environment variables in your remote repository.
Your `.env` file can look something like this:

```shell
MONGO_URI=mongodb://somewhere:27017
SESSION_SECRET=lolthisissecret
```

Now we can access one of these variables with something like `process.env.MONGO_URI`!
